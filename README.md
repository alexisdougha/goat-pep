# goat-pep
A repository to convert and navigate between XYZ files for quantum chemistry calculations and PDB files suitable for peptides.

You can prepare input files for Orca 6 to run a conformer search with GOAT. Check the Orca doc [here](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.0/tutorials/prop/goat.html) and the paper about GOAT [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202500393).

Starting from the PDB and the smiles files generated by [PEP-EDIT](https://pep-edit.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/), use ```pep-edit_to_orca.py``` to generate the .inp and .xyz files required by Orca.

For instance, run ```python pep-edit_to_orca.py data/pep-edit_to_orca/inputs/pep-edit_structure.pdb data/pep-edit_to_orca/inputs/pep-edit_smiles.txt ./data/pep-edit_to_orca/outputs```

Then if you want to map the xyz file generated by orca to pdb files for further analysis with PDB-compatible tools, you can ```use orca_xyz_to_pdb.py```.

For instance, run ```python orca_xyz_to_pdb.py data/orca_xyz_to_pdb/inputs/pep-edit_structure.pdb data/orca_xyz_to_pdb/inputs/orca_conformations.xyz data/orca_xyz_to_pdb/outputs```
